ANPR SYSTEM PROGRAM

This is my very first bigb project spanning multiple months

This program was deisgned to operate a ANPR system. This program excludes the operation of the camera
and just receives the data from the camrra in a array which is uploaded to a csv file. This all happens
in the Operatormenu. The admin menu processes these files to PNC marked files, SP amrked and all marked vehicles to be 
reported to the headquarters of the police. The system also has passwords in place for both menus. Everything
had been done using the JAVA gui system.
